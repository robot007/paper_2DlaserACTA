# 2D laser Sparce Hough transform
This repository includes laser cloud point processing algorithm, paper, raw data, data plots, C++ and Matlab code. A sparge Hough transform algorithm was developed for car bumper identification. You can use the algorithm for any line segmentation as well.

1. DataPlots: data and plots (in EPS and JPG)
2. LaserData: raw laser scanner data.
3. SparseHoughTransformCPP: C++ implementation, using Visual Studio. 
4. SparseHoughTransformMatlab: Matlab impelmentation on the algorithm and data ploting code.
5. ZhenSPIE03: Conference paper.
3. PublicVersionSongIJRA05v6: Journal paper.
